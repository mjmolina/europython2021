## Europython 2021: DIY Home automation with Microcontrollers and CircuitPython :seedling: ü§ñ üêç

### Talk description

When learning and using Python for automation, we usually write applications
that can help us on computer related tasks, like downloading things,
open programs, generating documents, etc, but Python gives us the opportunity
to automate things beyond our computers.

For many years, people have been filling their home with devices that are
based on Microcontrollers, like virtual assistants, smart fridges,
washing machines, security systems, and many others that can be either
programmable, or even replicated with a couple of boards and our Python
knowledge.

During this talk, we will start exploring CircuitPython without the need of a
physical device, using a microcontroller emulator. If you are new to the
microcontroller world, don‚Äôt worry, we will have an introduction to the main
concepts, so we have the base knowledge to start doing little experiments by
ourselves.

After the introduction, you will be able to start programming microcontrollers
using the emulator, and later you will see a couple of real projects
(with real devices!) that could easily be replicated by yourself:
a movement-detector, a low-cost robot cleaner, and a plant watering and
monitoring system.

### Outline

`[Introduction]` Basic concepts
- Talk motivation
- Introduction to Microcontrollers and CircuitPython. 
- How to use an emulator for hardware programming.

`[Home automation examples]` Using the code on real devices.
- Low-cost robot cleaner.
- Watering plant system.

**Note:** This emulator allows to program 3 different microcontrollers. 
This talk is focused on the
[Circuit Playground Express (CPX)](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/overview)
and the same microcontroller is used for automation examples.

### Setup

For the simulator, please check the [installation](installation.md) guide,
and then the [using simulator](using_simulator.md) tutorial to get your
code working.

### Previous projects

One of the ideas of this project is the starting project called "Plantaris
Solar" which is a follow up of the two previous projects I have been working on,

* [Plantaris Data](https://github.com/mjmolina/plantaris_data)
