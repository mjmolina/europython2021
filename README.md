## Europython 2021: DIY Home automation with Microcontrollers and CircuitPython :seedling: ü§ñ üêç


### Talk description:

When learning and using Python for automation, we usually write applications
that can help us on computer related tasks, like downloading things,
open programs, generating documents, etc, but Python gives us the opportunity
to automate things beyond our computers.

For many years, people have been filling their home with devices that are
based on Microcontrollers, like virtual assistants, smart fridges,
washing machines, security systems, and many others that can be either
programmable, or even replicated with a couple of boards and our Python
knowledge.

During this talk, we will start exploring CircuitPython without the need of a physical device, using a microcontroller emulator. If you are new to the microcontroller world, don‚Äôt worry, we will have an introduction to the main concepts, so we have the base knowledge to start doing little experiments by ourselves.


After the introduction, you will be able to start programming microcontrollers
using the emulator, and later you will see a couple of real projects
(with real devices!) that could easily be replicated by yourself:
a movement-detector, a low-cost robot cleaner, and a plant watering and
monitoring system.

### Outline

`[Introduction]` Basic concepts
- Talk motivation
- Introduction to Microcontrollers and CircuitPython. 
- How to use an emulator for hardware programming.

`[Home automation examples]` Using the code on real devices.

- Low-cost robot cleaner.
- Watering and monitoring plant system.


**Note:** This emulator allows to program 3 different microcontrollers. 
We will program the [Adafruit Circuit Playground Express (CPX)](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/overview)
and the same microcontroller will be used for the experimental and demo part.
